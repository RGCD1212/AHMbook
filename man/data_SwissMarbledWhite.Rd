\description{
Detection/nondetection data for the Marbled White butterfly (\emph{Melanargia galathea}) collected from 1998 to 2010 at a total of 519 study plots in Switzerland, as part of the Swiss Biodiversity Monitoring, which were each sampled once every five years with 11 visits each year, resulting in 1337 observed detection histories.
