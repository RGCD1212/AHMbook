\title{
Validates simulated observational data against data-generating values.}
\description{
In cases where species identifications (from photos, recorded calls, etc) is doubtful, it is feasible for a subset of the data to be validated by experts. Chambert et al (2017) used simulations to investigate the effectiveness of such partial validation. Where a data set with false positives has been simulated and the true status is known, \code{valid_data} compares a randomly-selected subset with truth and returns the result.% Not sure what it returns right now!
}
\usage{
valid_data(N, tp, n.valid, prop.valid=FALSE)

}
\arguments{
  \item{N}{
data matrix of ALL detection counts (true positives and false positives).
}
  \item{tp}{
data matrix of true positive (TP) detection counts.
}
  \item{n.valid}{
the number of detections to be validated (if \code{prop.valid=FALSE)} or the proportion of detections to be validated (if \code{prop.valid=TRUE)}.}
  \item{prop.valid}{
logical; determines how \code{n.valid} is interpreted.
}
}
\value{
A list with components n and k.% More later!!

## Maybe not necessary, would need a simulated data set.
